Create an app or dashboard that can predict whether someone is at high
risk for COVID-19.
- **Goal**: Build a machine learning model that, given a COVID-19 patient's current
symptom, status, and medical history, will predict whether the patient is at high
risk or not. This can either have a graphical user interface or just be a script.

## Resources:
- [COVID-19 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meirnizri/covid19-dataset)

## Logistic Regression Model:
- [Logistic-ML-COVID-19.ipynb](./Logistic-ML-COVID-19.ipynb)

## Nueral Network Model:
- [neural_covid_classifier.py](./neural_covid_classifier.py)

## Nueral Network Usage:
- See [example_run.sh](./example_run.sh)

## GUI Code:
- [nodejstest](./nodejstest)
Added short todo, with short explanation of the most current major bug.
connected HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and python.
Documentation nonexistent, sorry.
Uses node.js and express
