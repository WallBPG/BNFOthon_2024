Create an app or dashboard that can predict whether someone is at high
risk for COVID-19.
- **Goal**: Build a machine learning model that, given a COVID-19 patient's current
symptom, status, and medical history, will predict whether the patient is at high
risk or not. This can either have a graphical user interface or just be a script.
